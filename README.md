# ActorSystemPrototype

This is a actor framework prototype, I want to use to implement an actor based interpreted programming language.

The initial goal is not to create a new actor framework, but to create a programming language that is tuned for
debugging and working in a repl. Thats why the initial implementation of the "actor system" is rather rudimentary.

In the long run, I hope this will evolve into a usable language, but for now its just gonna be an experiment.
